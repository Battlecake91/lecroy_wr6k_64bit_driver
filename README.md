# LeCroy WR6k 64-bit driver reconstruction

Reverse-engineering project for the legacy LeCroy S65 acquisition kernel driver used by the WaveRunner 6000-series software.

## Goal

Reconstruct the externally visible behaviour of the original 32-bit `LecS65AcqDrv.sys` and implement a native x64 replacement suitable for modern 64-bit Windows.

The priority is compatibility with the existing LeCroy user-mode software:

- preserve device / interface behaviour where required;
- preserve IOCTL values and buffer layouts;
- preserve hardware access semantics;
- replace the obsolete x86 DriverWorks implementation with maintainable WDK code.

## Current state

The original driver has been statically analysed. Confirmed facts and the first IOCTL map are documented in:

- [docs/original-driver-analysis.md](docs/original-driver-analysis.md)
- [docs/ioctl-map.md](docs/ioctl-map.md)

No replacement driver code has been written yet. This is intentional: the ABI and hardware interface are being reconstructed first.

## Reference binary

Analysed binary:
